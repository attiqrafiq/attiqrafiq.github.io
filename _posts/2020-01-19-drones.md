## Do cities need drones?

According to a [report](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation/aerospace_forecasts/media/Unmanned_Aircraft_Systems.pdf) by the United States Federal Aviation Agency, 4.47 million small drones are expected to operate in the United States by 2021, up from today's 2.75 million. Since 2017, more than 1 million drone owners have already registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). So far, [as expected](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10846-017-0483-z), the main driving force behind this rapid increase in commercial drone purchases is their high mobility and applications in computer vision: taking pictures in dangerous areas, building inspection, traffic monitoring, photogammetry, etc. 
However, **this is just the beginning**. Drones are expected to carry out important tasks in future cities: They will provide a bird's eye view from the sky reporting in no time if a bridge is about to collapse, a fire is spreading or a human being is in trouble. They will [supplement our transport systems](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/flying-high-challenge-future-of-drone-technology-in-uk-cities/exploring-urban-drone-integration/) by moving things around or getting someone somewhere quickly. In fact, [Amazon's Prime Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Air) drone delivery service is already in its final development stage before beginning operations. Drones will also be robots on wings, performing such tasks as repairing bridges or fighting fires.
In this post, we will discuss how drones will affect cities, and how urban planners will have to extend their scope of expertise to be able to deal with urban airspace, urban air traffic, and its interplay with traditional urban space. We will do this by solving the problem of the efficient placement of drone stations in a city and seeing how different urban air traffic configurations lead affect operation zones. 

## Why should urban planners be concerned?

So far, most of us have been seeing drones only occasionally. But what will happen when swarms of drones flood our cities? **We can confidently expect the deployment of drones at scale to pose some significant challenges to planning, managing, and designing sustainable cities**. 
The proliferation of drone technology at scale would have an impact on the nature of our cities. Certain types of drone applications will require new physical infrastructure. 

Drone systems could affect the way buildings are designed and built. For instance, if **drone docking stations** will be placed on building roofs, the rooftop will have to be easily accessible for humans, but also for transporting goods to and from it. New buildings would have to be designed to accommodate this (for example, with additional internal or external elevator shafts). It could also be a serious challenge retrofitting old buildings to the new conditions. The visual impact on the built environment would also need to be considered.

New types infrastructure such as **passenger and logistic hubs** forming a drone mobility network, as well as ground-based **counter drone systems** equipped with **radars, signal jammers and drone capturing technology** for combatting rogue or dangerous drones will emerge. Integrating all of this with the existing built environment and creating the necessary regulatory framework for it to function will have a great impact on how architects, urban planners and policy makers work.

Highly automated drone operations will require fixed docking stations for take off and landing integrated with charging or refuelling systems. This could be a mobile or permanent station placed on the top of buildings, at street level, [integrated into existing transport infrastructure](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/flying-high-challenge-future-of-drone-technology-in-uk-cities/exploring-urban-drone-integration/), with smaller stations possibly on other types of infrastructure such as lampposts. These docking stations will most likely be integrated with electric battery charging. Given the energy policies of most developed countries, the impact of the soaring electricity demand on the grid and associated emissions will have to to be considered and carefully planned for.

For instance, the cost of privately owning drones can be [considerably more expensive compared to renting them](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8288882), especially for companies who may only require drones for a single task. However, with a city-wide rental system in place, the city, companies, and users will not be required to purchase drones effectively distributing the cost amongst them. 
Therefore, planning a drone rental service based on a system of drone ports (or stations) distributed across city is necessary. By providing a public drone rental service of distributed autonomous drones waiting at drone ports, this can reduce the total number of drones in the sky and the total cost of utilizing drones to complete tasks requested by the city services, citizens, and other users.
This implies the necessity of addressing the following questions among many others: 
* **where to place the docking stations?**
* **How many of them?**
* **With what capacity?**

## The facility location problem
The above questions can be answered with the help of mathematical optimization, particularly with [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) if formulated as a [capacitated facility location problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facility_location_problem#Capacitated_facility_location).

The latter is a classical optimization problem for choosing the sites for factories, warehouses, power sttaions, or other infrastructure. A typical facility location problem deals with determining the best among potentially available sites, subject to specific constraints requiring that demands at several locations be serviced by the opened facilities. The costs associated to such an initiative include a part which is usually proportional to the sum of distances from the facilities to the demand locations, as well as to the costs of opening and maintaining the facilities. 
**The objective of the problem is to select facility sites in order to minimize total costs**. The facilities may or may not have limited capacities for servicing, which classifies the problems into capacited and uncapacited variants. 

### Let's give some context!
Imagine a situation in which we are tasked with sketching a concept plan for the placement of drone docking stations in Yerevan city. Having the spatial distribution of daily (hourly, weekly, or monthly for that matter) demand in the city:

as well as a number of potential sites:

**how do we determine the best locations for placing the docking stations?** Well, it obviously depends on the costs.

The first type of cost is that of purchasing and installing the docking stations. To simplify matters, let's assume [Alonso's monocentric city model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_rent_theory) according to which real estate prices drop according to some exponential or power decay with increasing distance from the central business district:

### Mathematical formulation

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
{\text { minimize }} & {\sum_{j=1}^{m} f_{j} y_{j}+\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} c_{i j} x_{i j}} \\
{\text { subject to: }} & {\sum_{j=1}^{m} x_{i j}=d_{i}} \\
{} & {\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i j}=d_{i}} \\
{} & {\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i j} \leq M_{j} y_{j}} \\
{x_{i j}} & {\leq 0 \quad \text { for } i=1, \cdots, n ; j=1, \cdots, m} \\
{} & {x_{i j} \in\{0,1\}} & {\text { for } j=1, \cdots, m}
\end{array}
