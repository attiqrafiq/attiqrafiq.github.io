This is a short note reflecting on the implications of the current AI paradigms on the future of urban planning.

## AI planning assistant 

Let's say it's 2050 and you have an AI planner assistant system helping you to achieve certain targets in the new city masterplan. For instance, one of the objectives as part of the urban economic policy for the masterplan is to achieve a low [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) (i.e. low inequality).

If the current AI paradigm, namely that which is called the ["standard model"](https://futureoflife.org/2019/10/08/ai-alignment-podcast-human-compatible-artificial-intelligence-and-the-problem-of-control-with-stuart-russell/?cn-reloaded=1) where an algorithm optimizes a fixed objective (e.g. minimizes a defined loss function), becomes the cornerstone for future developments, **we will have a problem**: in simple terms, a machine more "intelligent" than us will achieve the "fixed objective", or the purpose we put in the machine, using whatever means and won't care of any side-effects. 

For example*, the spatial distribution of some values in London, shown in the top left in the below image (**A**) has the **exact same** Gini coefficient as its spatially reshuffled versions (**B**, **C**, **D**).
While the measure of inequality is the same in all cases, the reshuffled versions **B** and **C** clearly show a spatial segregation of high vs. low values.

In the case of income this would imply achieving the fixed objective though what urban planners call [exclusionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_zoning) rather than [inclusionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusionary_zoning) masterplanning.
The machine could have come up with such a policy proposal resulting in spatial segregation by optimizing for many important things (e.g. resources, various economic indicators, etc.) typically set as objective functions in economic optimization problems. 
Therefore, it is crucial to have AI systems that defer to humans in the process of high impact decision making. 

## Beneficial AI

While [explainable AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) is gaining momentum nowadays, I find the so called [apprenticeship learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship_learning) via [inverse reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06877) described by initially by Stuart Russell and Andrew Ng very promising in making sure humans remain in control.
In a traditional reinforcement learning setting, the goal is to learn a behavior that maximizes a predefined reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), turns the problem on its head: **it tries to extract an approximation of the reward function given the observed behavior of an agent**.

Since humans often have irrational and inconsistent preferences, the IRL system will have a hard time learning them, and the only way to deal with it is by introducing uncertainty in the learnt reward function - for example, via a distribution of net utilities to the human(s) in charge.

Coming back to the AI planning assistant system, imagine it has come up with a policy achieving the desired Gini coefficient in a resource-efficient way resulting in a certain spatial distribution, as discussed above. However, the system is unsure whether such an outcome is desirable to the city, and this uncertainty is described by a normal distribution of net utilities with mean 20 and standard deviation of 20.

*A more amusing example: an "intelligent" vacuum cleaner (with the fixed objective to make sure there is no dust in the house)  might at some point come up with another way to fight dust: get rid of its source! This is clearly something you don't want to happen without you being in control since a good part of the indoor dust comes from human hair and skin cells.
