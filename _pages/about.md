I'm a spatial data scientist and urban planner studying cities with machine learning, spatial statistics, and complex networks techniques at the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) in Pisa, Italy. Here I share my work, ideas, insights, replications of peer papers, as well as discussions about urban data science, smart cities, data-driven urban planning, urban economics, and how cities *actually* work. 

Do not hesitate to contact me for questions, suggestions, and collaborations.
