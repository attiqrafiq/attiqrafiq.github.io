I'm a spatial data scientist and urban planner studying cities with machine learning, spatial statistics, and complex networks techniques. Here I share my work, ideas, insights, replications of peer papers, as well as discussions about urban data science, smart cities, data-driven urban planning, urban economics, and how cities actually work.
