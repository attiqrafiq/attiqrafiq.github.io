## The Gini coefficient

In urban policy making, we are often confronted with the need to assess the income inequality of the urban population for such purposes as granting tax cuts to businesses targeting certain income groups, or identifying low-income households for offering housing subsidies in the form of cheap credit.
However, wealth or income are not the only quantities the inequality or heterogeneity of which an urban planner would be interested in. For example, urban mobility flows are often concentrated in a few areas capturing a disproportionately large portion of the overall city flows, and knowing how severe this heterogeneity is along with monitoring its trends over time would be the first step towards a meaningful transportation policy, allocation of services and infrastructure such as parking, as well as largely masterplanning.

That said, the most common way to measure inequality is the [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) which has been in use by economists for more than a hundred years already.

For any distribution of values of interest $$X$$ in a city, the Gini coefficient can be defined as:

$$G I=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\left|\boldsymbol{x}_{i}-\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\right|}{2 n^{2} \overline{\boldsymbol{x}}}$$,

where $$x_i$$ is the $$X$$ value at location $$i=[1,2, \ldots, n]$$ and $$x=(1 / n) \sum_{i} x_{i}$$.

As already mentioned, the Gini coefficient, originally used to measure wealth and income inequality, can be  applied  to  quantify  the  heterogeneity  of  other  variables  too.  In  the  case  of characterising heterogeneity of values at different locations in a city, as can be seen from the above equation, the Gini coefficient will take on the value of zero if the variable of interest is distributed uniformly across city locations. Conversely, it takes on its maximum value when all of the variables of interest  are  concentrated  in  a  single  location,  leading  to  a  Gini  coefficient  of $$GI=1âˆ’1/n$$, which is very close to 1 for large $$n$$. 

## Computing the Gini coefficient

Let's make things clear with an example. Let's say we want to understand how unequal parking demand is distributed in London, and use the Gini coefficient as a measure of this inequality. Below is a plot of what it looks like for the available data at a resolution of $$500 \times 500$$m grid.

As one might expect, we see a hotspots of high parking demand. Indeed, if we look at the distribution of the number of trips ending in a given location over a week (essentially weekly aggregate parking demand),

we see an assymatric Pareto-like distribution, with a few locations displaying very high, and most locations very low demand. If we compute the Gini coefficient with the expression above, we obtain a value of roughly 0.6. Although the temporal evolution of this measure would be more meaningful to track, this value indicates a medium-high inequality if thought of in economic terms.

## So what's wrong with it?

In the definition of the Gini coefficient, we mentioned a key word: **location**. Urban planning is first and foremost about *space*. Whether it's design, management, logistics, or planning, practitioners are working with *space*. But look carefully at the definition of the widely used Gini coefficient: space - in this case geographical - does not figure in it. The Gini coefficient is completely agnostic to the spatial arrangement of the location of the values of interest. The following four arrangements - the true parking demand and its spatially reshuffled configurations have **the exact same Gini coefficient**:

In other words, the Gini coefficient fails to capture any spatial information about our variable of interest.

## What should we do?

In the field of [spatial statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis) there have been proposed many measures indicative of the spatial component of the variable under study. We will discuss two of them which I find particularly useful to combine with the Gini coefficient when studying the urban environment.

### Spatial Gini

In  order  to  obtain  a  Gini  coefficient  that  carries  meaningful  spatial  information,we further use the Spatial Gini index. In essence, it isa decomposition of the classical Gini with the aim of considering the joint effects ofinequality and spatial autocorrelation. More specifically, it exploits the fact that thesum of all pairwise differences can be decomposed into sums of geographical neighborsand non-neighbours:
