## The Gini coefficient

In urban policy making, we are often confronted with the need to assess the income inequality of the urban population for such purposes as granting tax cuts to businesses targeting certain income groups, or identifying low-income households for offering housing subsidies in the form of cheap credit.
However, Wealth or income are not the only quantities the inequality or heterogeneity of which an urban planner would be interested in. For example, urban mobility flows are often concentrated in a few areas capturing a disproportiantely large portion of the overall city flows and knowing how severe this heterogeneity is and monitoring its trend would be the first step towards a meaningful transportation policy, allocation of services, and masterplanning.
The most common way to measure inequality is the [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) which has been in use by economists for more than a hundred years already.

For any distribution of values of interest $$X$$ in a city, the Gini coefficient can be defined as:

$$G I=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\left|\boldsymbol{x}_{i}-\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\right|}{2 n^{2} \overline{\boldsymbol{x}}}$$,

where $$x_i$$ is the $$X$$ value at location $$i=[1,2, \ldots, n]$$ and $$x=(1 / n) \sum_{i} x_{i}$$.
